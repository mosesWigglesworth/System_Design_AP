## 📘 **1. Introduction to Database Scaling**

### 🧠 **Core Idea**

Databases are:

* ✅ **Critical**: Every system depends on them.
* ⚠️ **Brittle**: They're often the **first to choke** under heavy load.

### 📈 **Why Scale Databases?**

As your system grows (more users, more data, more queries), your **database must keep up**, or everything slows down or breaks.

### 🔀 **Types of Databases This Applies To**

* **Relational (SQL)**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.
* **Non-relational (NoSQL)**: MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.

📌 The strategies discussed aren’t limited to just SQL or NoSQL—they apply to **any stateful service**, especially **databases**.

---

## 🏗️ **2. Vertical Scaling (a.k.a. Scaling Up)**

### 💡 **Definition**

Increasing the **resources (power)** of your **single database server**.

> "Give the same horse a bigger carriage, instead of buying another horse."

### ⚙️ **What Resources Do We Add?**

* 🧠 **More RAM**
* 🧮 **More CPU**
* 💾 **More Disk Storage**

---

### 🧪 **Real-World Example**

* You start with a 4GB RAM database → handles initial load well.
* As users grow, this becomes insufficient.
* So you upgrade to 8GB → now it can handle more traffic.

💻 In **cloud environments** (AWS, GCP, Azure):

* Just **2-3 clicks** in the UI to upgrade.
* No need to manually copy data.
* **BUT:** Some **downtime** is inevitable because the DB **restarts**.

---

### ⛔ **Limitations of Vertical Scaling**

It **can’t go on forever**.

#### 📵 Physical Limits:

* Every machine has a **max capacity** for RAM, CPU, etc.
* E.g., A smartphone may support up to 128GB SD card. Insert 1TB → won’t work.

#### 🔬 Technical Reason:

* Underlying **hardware limitations** (cache, bus speed, architecture).
* Cloud providers **cap your max specs**.

---

### ✅ **When to Use Vertical Scaling**

| Scenario                                             | Should You Use Vertical Scaling?          |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Early stage, small load                              | ✅ YES, it's simple and quick              |
| Mid-scale, growing traffic                           | ✅ YES, if you haven’t hit physical limits |
| Massive scale (millions of users, petabytes of data) | ❌ NO, consider **horizontal scaling**     |

---

### 🧑‍🔧 **SRE/Triage Engineer Tip**

When you see **DB CPU/RAM consistently maxed**:

* First option: Recommend vertical scaling.
* But: Monitor the **downtime window** and **alert teams** in advance.

| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Database Scaling** | Adjusting DB power to meet growing load      | 📊📦   |
| **Vertical Scaling** | Add more resources to the same DB server     | 📈🖥️  |
| **Pros**             | Simple, quick, cloud-supported               | ✅🧑‍💻 |
| **Cons**             | Downtime, hard limit to how much you can add | ⚠️🚫   |
| **Physical Limits**  | Hardware can’t go beyond fixed architecture  | 🧠🔧   |

---

## 📘 **3. Horizontal Scaling using Read Replicas**

---

### 💡 What is Horizontal Scaling?

Instead of **scaling a single machine (vertical)**, you **add more machines** to distribute the load.

> 🧠 *“Instead of upgrading your horse, get more horses!”*

---

### 🔄 Use Case: **Read Replicas**

Most systems have **90% reads** and only **10% writes**.
So, if the **read load is high**, let’s **offload those reads** to another machine = **read replica**.

---

### 🧱 Architecture Breakdown

| Component           | Role                                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Master Database** | Handles all **writes**                         |
| **Read Replica**    | Handles **only reads**, synced from the master |

---

### 📤 How Reads & Writes Are Routed

**At the API Layer**:

* Create **two DB connections**:

  * One for **Master**
  * One for **Read Replica**
* Based on the operation:

  * 🔍 **Reads** → Use read replica
  * ✍️ **Writes** → Use master

```java
if (operation == "read") {
    use(readReplicaConnection);
} else {
    use(masterConnection);
}
```

📌 **Important:** This is **not automatic**.
You need to **program logic in the API server** to send the query to the correct DB.

---

### ✅ Benefits

* Scalability: Offload heavy reads to replicas
* Performance: Master handles less, so writes are faster
* Simplicity: No changes in data schema or app behavior

---

### 🧑‍🔧 SRE/Triage Engineer Tip:

* Look for **high read latency or DB CPU spikes** on master → consider offloading to read replica.
* Monitor **replica lag** if users report **inconsistent read-after-write behavior**.

---

## ⚖️ **4. Replication Modes: Synchronous vs Asynchronous**

---

Once you have **read replicas**, the big question is:
**How do replicas get updated with the latest writes?**

That’s handled through **Replication**, and it comes in **two modes**:

---

### 🔗 1. **Synchronous Replication**

> “Write happens on **both master and replica**, and only then it's considered successful.”

---

#### 📤 Flow:

1. Client sends write request → API server.
2. API writes to **master** AND **replica**.
3. Only after **both writes succeed**, response sent to client.

#### ✅ Pros:

* ✅ **Strong consistency** — Master & replica are always in sync.
* ✅ Zero replication lag.

#### ❌ Cons:

* 🐢 **Slower writes** due to waiting for two DBs.
* ❗ Higher write latency, may affect user experience.

#### 🧑‍🔧 Triage Tip:

Use this in **financial systems**, logs, or where **absolute consistency** matters (e.g., bank transactions, orders).

---

### 🔁 2. **Asynchronous Replication** (Default for most DBs)

> “Write happens on **master**, and **replica catches up later**.”

---

#### 📤 Flow:

1. Client sends write request → API server.
2. API writes to **master** only → returns success.
3. Replica **pulls** new changes from master **periodically** and applies them.

#### ✅ Pros:

* ⚡ **Fast writes** — No waiting for replica.
* 💪 Higher write throughput.

#### ❌ Cons:

* ❌ **Replication lag** — Replica may not have the latest data.
* ⚠️ Risk of **inconsistent reads** from replica (e.g., reading before replica syncs new data).

---

### 🔁 How Replicas Sync in Async Mode

* Master keeps a **log of changes**.
* Replica asks: “What happened since I last synced?”
* Master sends the **diff**, and replica updates.

| **Vertical Scaling**   | Buying a more powerful laptop                                            |
| **Horizontal Scaling** | Buying another laptop and splitting work                                 |
| **Synchronous**        | You send a parcel and wait till it’s delivered & signed before you leave |
| **Asynchronous**       | You drop the parcel and walk away; delivery will happen eventually       |

---

## 🧑‍🔧 Final Notes for SREs and Triage Engineers

* 📊 Always monitor **replica lag** and alert if it crosses acceptable thresholds.
* 🧪 Test **read-after-write consistency** in replicas before using them in user-facing flows.
* 🛠️ Most DB engines (MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB) support async replication by default.
* 🔄 For strong consistency across critical flows (like transactions), evaluate synchronous mode.

---

## 📦 **5. Sharding – Horizontal Scaling for Writes**

---

### 💡 What is Sharding?

**Sharding** = Splitting a **large dataset** into **smaller, independent chunks** (called *shards*), each stored in a **separate database node**.

> 🧠 *“Don’t put all your data eggs in one basket—split them across many baskets!”*

---

### 🧱 Why Do We Need Sharding?

So far we:

* ✅ Handled **read load** using **read replicas**
* ✅ Tried **vertical scaling** for writes

❗But when the **write load becomes too high**, or **one machine can’t store all data**, we need to **split the data**.

---

### 🧩 How Sharding Works

Let’s say we store **key-value pairs**, and keys are alphabets (A–Z).

We can split into:

* **Shard 1**: A–J
* **Shard 2**: K–T
* **Shard 3**: U–Z

Each shard is responsible for **only its range** of data — they are **mutually exclusive**.

---

### 🧑‍💻 API Server Responsibility: Routing Logic

* API server must **know** which shard handles which range.
* It implements a **routing function** like:

```python
if key in A to J:
    use shard1_connection
elif key in K to T:
    use shard2_connection
else:
    use shard3_connection
```

This is called **routing logic** – deciding **which database to hit** based on incoming request parameters.

---

### ✅ Benefits of Sharding

| Benefit                  | Explanation                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 **Load Reduction**    | Each DB handles less data and traffic  |
| 🚀 **Write Scalability** | Writes spread across multiple machines |
| 🧱 **Storage Scaling**   | Data volume is distributed             |

---

### ❗Things to Watch

* Requires **custom routing logic**
* Makes **cross-shard queries complex**
* Backup, replication, and failover are more **difficult**

---

### 🧑‍🔧 Triage/SRE Tip:

* Look for **CPU/disk pressure due to write volume** or **out-of-memory issues**—indicates sharding may be needed.
* Use **consistent hashing** or partitioning keys for better shard distribution.

---

## 🛠️ **6. Practical Implementation Recommendations**

---

### 🚀 What Should You Try Out?

The instructor strongly encourages hands-on practice:

* ✅ **Set up 2 databases** (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL)
* ✅ **Design your API server** to:

  * Fire **reads** on a **read replica**
  * Fire **writes** on a **master**

---

### 📘 Mini Project Ideas:

| Concept           | Idea                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Read Replica**  | Use MySQL + set up one as replica of another                        |
| **Sharding**      | Split student records by class (e.g., Class A → DB1, Class B → DB2) |
| **Routing Logic** | Add if-else logic in API controller to direct traffic               |

---

### 🎯 Goal

By implementing:

* You’ll gain clarity on **how routing, replication, sharding work**
* You’ll get hands-on experience with **core backend engineering principles**
