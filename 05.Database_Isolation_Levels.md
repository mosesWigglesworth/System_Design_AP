### **#1. Introduction to Database Isolation Levels**

#### ‚úÖ **Background Context**

Relational databases follow the **ACID** properties ‚Äî **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability** ‚Äî to ensure data reliability, especially in multi-user environments.

This topic focuses specifically on the **"I" in ACID**, which stands for **Isolation**.

---

### **üîç What Is Isolation in Databases?**

-   **Isolation** refers to how **independent** or **isolated** one transaction is from another when multiple transactions run **concurrently** (i.e., at the same time).
    
-   It controls **how much one transaction can "see" or be affected by another transaction** that is still in progress (i.e., not yet committed or rolled back).
    

**Why it's important**: Without proper isolation, one transaction could read or be affected by uncommitted data from another, leading to incorrect or inconsistent results ‚Äî this is known as a **concurrency issue**.

---

### **üîß What Are Isolation Levels?**

-   **Isolation levels** are the **configurable settings** provided by the database to **tune** this behavior.
    
-   They define **how much "transparency" or visibility** exists **between parallel transactions**.
    

Think of isolation levels as **"privacy settings"** for transactions:

-   Low isolation ‚Üí transactions can see more of each other (less safe but faster).
    
-   High isolation ‚Üí transactions are more hidden from each other (more safe but can be slower).
    

---

### **üß© The Four Standard Isolation Levels (SQL-1992 Standard)**

1.  **Repeatable Read**
    
2.  **Read Committed**
    
3.  **Read Uncommitted**
    
4.  **Serializable**
    

> These will be discussed **one-by-one** using **hands-on examples and queries** to clearly demonstrate how they work and impact transaction visibility.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaway

-   **Isolation** ensures that **concurrent transactions** don‚Äôt interfere with each other in ways that break data integrity.
    
-   The **isolation level you choose** balances between **performance** and **data consistency**.
    
-   Understanding how each level behaves will help you **choose the right one** for your application needs.
    

---

## ‚úÖ **#2. Repeatable Read Isolation Level**

### üîç What is Repeatable Read?

**Repeatable Read** is an isolation level that ensures:

> **Any data you read once in a transaction will appear the same if read again within the same transaction ‚Äî even if other transactions update that data and commit.**

This provides **consistency in reads** during the lifespan of a transaction.

---

### üß™ **Practical Example Overview (MySQL)**

#### **Setup:**

-   A `users` table with 2 fields: `id` (Primary Key), `name`
    
-   Initial data:
    
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES (1, 'A');
    ```
    
-   Two sessions:
    
    -   **Session 1** ‚Üí Transaction T1
        
    -   **Session 2** ‚Üí Transaction T2
        

#### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Breakdown

1.  **Check Isolation Level**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT @@TRANSACTION_ISOLATION; -- Output: REPEATABLE-READ
    ```
    
2.  **Start Transactions in Both Sessions**
    
    ```sql
    SET autocommit = 0;
    START TRANSACTION;
    ```
    
3.  **Initial Read**
    
    -   Both T1 and T2 run:
        
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
        -- Output: id = 1, name = 'A'
        ```
        
4.  **Transaction T1 Updates the Row (But Doesn‚Äôt Commit Yet)**
    
    ```sql
    UPDATE users SET name = 'T1' WHERE id = 1;
    ```
    
5.  **Read After Update**
    
    -   T1 reads:
        
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
        -- Output: id = 1, name = 'T1' (Sees its own uncommitted change)
        ```
        
    -   T2 reads:
        
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
        -- Output: id = 1, name = 'A' (Still sees the original value)
        ```
        
6.  **Transaction T1 Commits**
    
    ```sql
    COMMIT;
    ```
    
7.  **T2 Reads Again ‚Äî After T1 Commit**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
    -- Output: id = 1, name = 'A' (Still sees the old value!)
    ```
    
    > ‚úÖ This is the key behavior of Repeatable Read ‚Äî it guarantees that **within the same transaction**, any row read once will **always return the same value**, even if other transactions have committed changes to it.
    
8.  **Now T2 Commits and Starts a New Transaction**
    
    ```sql
    COMMIT; -- T2 commits
    START TRANSACTION;
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
    -- Output: id = 1, name = 'T1' (Now sees the updated value)
    ```
    

---

### üîê Behavior Summary of Repeatable Read:

| Action | Value Seen in T2 |
| --- | --- |
| Before T1 update | `A` |
| After T1 update, before commit | `A` |
| After T1 commit, within same T2 | `A` |
| After T2 commits and starts fresh Txn | `T1` |

---

### üîÅ Why It‚Äôs Called **Repeatable** Read?

Because every time you repeat the **same read** within a transaction, **you get the same value** ‚Äî even if others change it **after your first read**, you **don‚Äôt see their changes** unless you start a new transaction.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Side Note

-   This prevents **non-repeatable reads** (where values change mid-transaction).
    
-   But it **doesn't prevent phantom reads** ‚Äî which we‚Äôll address in the next isolation level (`Serializable`).
    

---

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

-   Repeatable Read ensures **read consistency within a transaction**.
    
-   Once you read a row, that view is **locked in** for the life of the transaction.
    
-   You won‚Äôt see changes made by others until **your transaction ends** and a new one begins.
    
-   Useful for systems where **read stability is critical**, like generating reports or audits.
    

---

## ‚úÖ **#3. Read Committed Isolation Level**

### üîç What Is Read Committed?

**Read Committed** is an isolation level where:

> Every time a transaction **reads data**, it gets the **latest committed version** of that data at that moment.

In other words:

-   Your transaction will **not see uncommitted changes** from other transactions (avoids dirty reads ‚úÖ).
    
-   But, if another transaction commits a change while yours is still running, and you **re-read** the same data ‚Äî you **may see a different value**.
    

---

### üîÑ Key Difference from Repeatable Read

| Feature | Repeatable Read | Read Committed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sees uncommitted data? | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| Sees committed changes mid-Txn? | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Re-reading gives same result? | ‚úÖ Always | ‚ùå Might be different |

---

### üß™ Practical Walkthrough (Using MySQL)

#### **1\. Set Isolation Level**

```sql
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
```

Confirm using:

```sql
SELECT @@TRANSACTION_ISOLATION;
-- Output: READ-COMMITTED
```

Do this in **both sessions** (T1 and T2).

---

#### **2\. Start Two Transactions**

```sql
SET autocommit = 0;
START TRANSACTION;
```

---

#### **3\. Initial Read in T1**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
-- Output: name = 'A'
```

---

#### **4\. T2 Updates the Row**

```sql
UPDATE users SET name = 'T2' WHERE id = 1;
```

Read in T2:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
-- Output: name = 'T2'
```

---

#### **5\. T2 Commits**

```sql
COMMIT;
```

---

#### **6\. Read Again in T1**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
-- Output: name = 'T2'
```

Even though **T1 is still running**, it now sees the **new committed value** from T2.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This would **not happen** in Repeatable Read ‚Äî there, T1 would have continued to see the original value `'A'`.

---

### üéØ Key Concept

**In Read Committed:**

-   Each `SELECT` reflects the **latest committed state** of the database.
    
-   Even within the same transaction, **repeated reads can return different results** if other transactions commit changes in between.
    

---

### üìâ Trade-Offs

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| No dirty reads (can‚Äôt see uncommitted changes) | Allows **non-repeatable reads** (values can change mid-txn) |
| Better concurrency / performance | Data can look **inconsistent** within the same transaction |

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

-   **Read Committed** allows a transaction to **see other committed changes** even before it ends.
    
-   It‚Äôs a **common default level** in many databases (e.g., Oracle).
    
-   Great for **performance**, but **not ideal** when you require **read consistency** across multiple operations in the same transaction.
    

---

## ‚úÖ **#4. Read Uncommitted Isolation Level**

### üîç What Is Read Uncommitted?

**Read Uncommitted** is the **lowest and most relaxed** isolation level.  
In this level, **a transaction can read data that has been modified by another transaction even if it hasn‚Äôt been committed yet**.

> This means:  
> ‚úÖ Highest performance  
> ‚ùå Lowest data consistency

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è The Key Problem: **Dirty Reads**

A **dirty read** occurs when:

-   One transaction (T2) modifies some data but **does not commit**.
    
-   Another transaction (T1) **reads that uncommitted data**.
    
-   If T2 later **rolls back**, T1 has already **seen and possibly acted on invalid data**.
    

---

### üß™ Practical Walkthrough (MySQL)

#### **1\. Set Isolation Level**

```sql
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
```

Validate in both sessions:

```sql
SELECT @@TRANSACTION_ISOLATION;
-- Output: READ-UNCOMMITTED
```

---

#### **2\. Start Transactions**

```sql
SET autocommit = 0;
START TRANSACTION;
```

Do this in **T1 and T2** sessions.

---

#### **3\. Read in T1**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
-- Output: name = 'A'
```

---

#### **4\. Update in T2 (Uncommitted)**

```sql
UPDATE users SET name = 'T2' WHERE id = 1;
-- Do NOT commit yet
```

---

#### **5\. Read Again in T1**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
-- Output: name = 'T2' ‚Üê Uncommitted!
```

Even though **T2 has not committed**, **T1 still sees the new value** ‚Äî this is a **dirty read**.

---

#### **6\. What If T2 Rolls Back?**

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

Now the value of `'T2'` is **gone**, but T1 has **already seen and possibly used** it in its logic.

‚û°Ô∏è This is **data inconsistency**.

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-Offs

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Fastest isolation level | Allows **dirty reads** (can read uncommitted data) |
| More concurrency (better performance) | High risk of **inconsistent or incorrect results** |
| Useful in special cases like **logging** | Not suitable for critical transactional systems |

---

### üéØ When to Use

You might use **Read Uncommitted** when:

-   Accuracy isn‚Äôt important (e.g., analytics dashboards, logs).
    
-   You need the absolute **maximum throughput**.
    
-   You are OK with temporary inconsistencies.
    

But you should **avoid it in financial, transactional, or sensitive systems**.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

-   **Read Uncommitted** allows one transaction to **see uncommitted changes** from another.
    
-   It can cause **dirty reads** ‚Äî the worst form of read anomaly.
    
-   Gives **highest performance**, but with **lowest data integrity**.
    
-   Use only when correctness can be compromised safely.
    

---

## ‚úÖ #5. Serializable Isolation Level

### üîç What Is Serializable?

**Serializable** is the **strictest and most conservative** isolation level defined in the SQL standard.

> It **completely eliminates concurrency issues** by **making transactions execute as if they were run one after the other (serially)** ‚Äî even if they are actually running in parallel.

It:

-   Prevents **dirty reads**, **non-repeatable reads**, and **phantom reads**.
    
-   Ensures **maximum consistency**.
    
-   Comes at the cost of **performance and throughput**.
    

---

### üîí How Does It Work?

-   Every **read is a locking read**, meaning:
    
    -   When **Transaction T1 reads or writes a row**, that **row is locked**.
        
    -   **Transaction T2 cannot read, write, or even access** that row **until T1 commits or rolls back**.
        
-   This creates **strong isolation** by **blocking** other transactions from interfering with the same data.
    

---

### üß™ Practical Example (MySQL)

#### **1\. Reset and Set Serializable Isolation Level**

```sql
SET autocommit = 0;
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

Check it:

```sql
SELECT @@TRANSACTION_ISOLATION;
-- Output: SERIALIZABLE
```

---

#### **2\. Start Both Transactions**

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
-- In both T1 and T2
```

---

#### **3\. T1 Updates the Row**

```sql
UPDATE users SET name = 'T1' WHERE id = 1;
```

Row is now **locked by T1**.

---

#### **4\. T2 Tries to Read the Same Row**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
-- ‚è≥ BLOCKED! ‚õî
```

T2 is **blocked** ‚Äî it **waits** until T1 completes.

---

#### **5\. T1 Commits**

```sql
COMMIT;
```

Now, **T2's SELECT proceeds** and reads the **committed value** `'T1'`.

---

### üìå Key Observations

| Feature | Serializable |
| --- | --- |
| Dirty reads | ‚ùå Prevented |
| Non-repeatable reads | ‚ùå Prevented |
| Phantom reads | ‚ùå Prevented |
| Read locks | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Write locks | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Blocking behavior | ‚úÖ Strong |
| Performance | üê¢ Slowest |
| Consistency | ‚úÖ Highest |

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-Offs

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Ensures full **ACID compliance** | Significantly **reduces concurrency** |
| Ideal for **mission-critical systems** | **Slower throughput and more locking** |
| Eliminates **all read anomalies** | Can lead to **transaction contention** |

---

### üéØ When to Use

Use **Serializable Isolation Level** when:

-   **Correctness is critical** (e.g., banking, accounting systems).
    
-   You cannot afford **any data anomalies**.
    
-   Throughput and speed are **less important** than accuracy.
    

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

-   **Serializable** makes the system behave as if transactions were run **one at a time**.
    
-   Offers **maximum data consistency** at the cost of **performance and concurrency**.
    
-   Transactions **block each other** aggressively to maintain strict isolation.
    
-   Most suitable for **high-integrity applications**.
    

---

## ‚úÖ #6. Conclusion and Summary

This final part of the discussion wraps up the topic of **Database Isolation Levels** by reinforcing these key points:

### üß† What Should You Take Away?

-   **Isolation** is the ‚ÄúI‚Äù in **ACID**, and it defines **how concurrent transactions interact**.
    
-   It governs **how visible changes from one transaction are to others** during execution.
    
-   Understanding this is **critical for database correctness**, especially in concurrent applications.
    

### üß™ Suggested Practice:

-   Take a **simple schema** with a single table and one row.
    
-   **Manually play with transactions** in two sessions:
    
    -   Read, write, commit, and roll back in different isolation levels.
        
    -   Observe **what gets read and when**.
        

This **hands-on approach** helps build **intuition** about:

-   **What is a lock?**
    
-   **What is dirty vs repeatable read?**
    
-   **When does a transaction see others‚Äô changes?**
    

---

## üßæ Final Summary: All Database Isolation Levels

Here‚Äôs a concise overview of all the isolation levels, their behavior, and when to use them:

| Isolation Level | Dirty Read | Non-repeatable Read | Phantom Read | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1\. Read Uncommitted** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | \- **Least strict**, allows reading uncommitted changes (dirty reads).  
\- **Fastest**, but may lead to inconsistent or invalid data. |
| **2\. Read Committed** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | \- Only reads **committed data**.  
\- Prevents dirty reads but not consistent repeat reads. |
| **3\. Repeatable Read** | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | \- Ensures the **same data is read consistently** within a transaction.  
\- Still allows phantom reads (new rows inserted). |
| **4\. Serializable** | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | \- **Most strict and safest.**  
\- Enforces **complete isolation** by locking rows.  
\- Slows down performance due to aggressive locking. |

-   Prevent subtle data bugs.
    
-   Tune performance vs. correctness.
    
-   Build reliable systems under concurrency.
