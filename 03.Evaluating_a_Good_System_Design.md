### **1\. Introduction to Evaluating a Good System**

⏱ (00:00 - 00:34)

> 🔹 Systems are *infinitely expandable*—you can keep adding features endlessly.

> 🔹 But the key question is:  
> 👉 **How do you know when it's *good enough*?**

> 🔹 Objective: Define a **structured, rational evaluation framework** to judge whether your system design is truly “good.”

### **2\. Breaking Down the System into Components**

⏱ (00:34 - 01:11)

> ✅ **First Evaluation Checkpoint**  
> Your system is decomposed into **logical components**, not treated as a monolithic block.

> 🧠 If asked to design "Facebook," don't draw one box.  
> Break it down into services like:

-   Authentication
    
-   News Feed
    
-   Messaging
    
-   Notifications, etc.
    

> 🔍 Clear decomposition shows clear thinking.

### **3\. Clear and Mutually Exclusive Responsibilities**

⏱ (01:11 - 04:31)

> ✅ **Second Evaluation Checkpoint**  
> Each component should have a **well-defined and exclusive responsibility**.

> 🧪 **Example: Feed System**

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Web Server | Serve final feed over HTTP to the end user. |
| Generator | Gather feed candidates from multiple sources (e.g., posts, follows, recommendations). |
| Aggregator | Filter & rank content from Generator’s data to produce the final feed. |

> 🔁 Even if all share a DB, **roles must not overlap**.

> 📌 No ambiguity = High-quality design.

---

### **4\. Technical Details for Each Component**

⏱ (04:31 - 05:35)

> ✅ **Third Evaluation Checkpoint**  
> Each component should have **some level of technical depth**, such as:

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Database** | What DB is used? Why? Is it scalable? |
| **Caching** | Any caching needed? Where and how? |
| **Asynchronous Handling** | Does the component require async queues or workers? |
| **Communication** | How does it talk to others? HTTP? RPC? Messaging queue? |

> 💡 *You don’t need to go into extreme detail*, but at least **touch all these technical dimensions** per component.

---

### **5\. Scalability, Fault Tolerance, and Availability**

⏱ (05:35 - 07:12)

> ✅ **Fourth Evaluation Checkpoint**  
> Each component should be evaluated against the **core system design pillars**:

| Aspect | Evaluation Questions |
| --- | --- |
| **Scalability** | Can it handle a huge load? Can you add more instances easily? |
| **Fault Tolerance** | What happens if a component fails? Will others continue working? |
| **Availability** | Will the system remain accessible during partial failures? Any single point of failure (SPOF)? |

> 💡 Ensure **no component is a bottleneck** or **SPOF**.  
> Use **load balancers**, **replication**, **queues**, etc., for robustness.

---

### **6\. Framework for System Evaluation and Conclusion**

⏱ (07:12 - 07:50)

> 🎯 **Final Thought**:  
> If your system design meets all **four checkpoints**, then you have built a **good system**.

> 🧱 This is a **reusable framework**:

1.  **Componentization**
    
2.  **Clear Responsibilities**
    
3.  **Technical Detailing**
    
4.  **Scalability & Fault Handling**
    

> ✅ Apply this consciously and structurally to every system you design.

## 📌 Final Summary: Evaluation Framework for a Good System

| # | Evaluation Criteria | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Break Down the System** | Decompose the system into logical, manageable components. |
| 2 | **Clear & Exclusive Responsibilities** | Each component has a distinct job. No overlaps. No confusion. |
| 3 | **Technical Depth per Component** | Think through database, caching, async needs, and communication type. |
| 4 | **Scalability, Fault Tolerance, Availability** | Make sure each component is scalable, resilient to failures, and always up. |
| 5 | **Final Evaluation Framework** | Apply this structured checklist to validate system quality. |
